<h2>My Top 3 Best movies Of all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Spirited Away</h2>
<p>This was the earliest animated movie I can remember watching. It showed me an interesting world<br /> 
    that at times fascinated me and at others genuinely creeped me out, and no I am not just <br />
    talking about Noface I am talking about the granny with a big head and a skin tag inbetween her<br />
     eyebrows named yubaba. </p>
     
<h2>Treasure Planet</h2> 
<p>This movie introduced me to space travel. Although more fantasy with all the flying seaships than what<br />
    you would expect from a scifi movie it made me think about what else could exist out there in the void of space.<br />
</p>  

<h2>Drive</h2>     
<p>I loved the tone of the movie and it's beautiful music.</p>
